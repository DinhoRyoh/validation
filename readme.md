## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## More Informations for Morgan Corroyer

I hope that you noticed that Included my own readMe to the laravel readMe.
the Project can be founded here : [click here](http://it-akademy.slides.com/morgan_corroyer/val-cared?token=Cjwmen4k#/1).
I'll explain the main facts:
The CARED class had to create an application/website to build an "webshopsite"

So I used laravel, it was requested.
There is a contact page: so I used the Collective laravel FORM.
My theme was League of Legends, I used an API to get all the existing champions,
you can find the API here:[Just click here](https://developer.riotgames.com/).
So yeah, We can't modify or delete the content, but I found it more useful to have big content
I added a function to the APP, a cart/wishlist for the common user(not the admin), he can access to it, and modify it.
the User also can send message to the admin using the contact form, see the code to see how it works.

in the other hand, the Admin can access to a view which permit to see all the mails/messages, and he can delete them.

To create different type of Users, I added a column named "admin" which contain 1 if the user is admin or 0 for the common user.

Now for the design...yeah I added "on purpose" difficulties for viewing all the champions... the main difficulty was the responsive layout.
It was the first time with JS.

I hope that I detailed all the most important things, Have a good day !
